    "summary": "The Xi-transform is a new spinor transform arising naturally in Einstein's\ngeneral relativity. Here the example of conformally flat space-time is\ndiscussed in detail. In particular it is shown that for this case, the\ntransform coincides with two other naturally defined transforms: one a\ntwo-variable transform on the Lie group SU(2, C), the other a transform on the\nspace of null split octaves. The key properties of the transform are developed.",
