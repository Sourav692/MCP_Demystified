## LexPam: Legal Procedure Awareness-Guided Mathematical Reasoning
- **Paper ID**: 2504.02590v1
- **Authors**: Kepu Zhang, Guofu Xie, Weijie Yu, Mingyue Xu, Xu Tang, Yaxin Li, Jun Xu
- **Published**: 2025-04-03
- **PDF URL**: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02590v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02590v1)

### Summary
The legal mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs is crucial when applying
them to real-world scenarios, as it directly affects the credibility of the
LLM. While existing legal LLMs can perform general judicial question answering,
their legal mathematical reasoning capabilities have not been trained.
Open-domain reasoning models, though able to generate detailed calculation
steps, do not follow the reasoning logic required for legal scenarios.
Additionally, there is currently a lack of legal math...

## Graph-constrained Reasoning: Faithful Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models
- **Paper ID**: 2410.13080v1
- **Authors**: Linhao Luo, Zicheng Zhao, Chen Gong, Gholamreza Haffari, Shirui Pan
- **Published**: 2024-10-16
- **PDF URL**: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13080v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13080v1)

### Summary
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
abilities, but they still struggle with faithful reasoning due to knowledge
gaps and hallucinations. To address these issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have
been utilized to enhance LLM reasoning through their structured knowledge.
However, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based,
encounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently
traversing KGs at scale. In this work, we introduce...

## Low progress math in a high performing system
- **Paper ID**: 2302.01910v1
- **Authors**: A. Jamaludin, A. I. Jabir, F. J. Wang, A. L. Tan
- **Published**: 2023-01-26

### Summary
Math anxiety negatively relates to math performance. This negative
relationship may be exacerbated in low-progress math learners. However, there
are limited studies on math anxiety among low progress learners in a
paradoxically high performing education system like Singapore. To fill this
research gap, this research analysed the anxiety profiles of 151 students who
were in the math learning support intervention program administered by the
Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE). We examined the c...

## Math Neurosurgery: Isolating Language Models' Math Reasoning Abilities Using Only Forward Passes
- **Paper ID**: 2410.16930v2
- **Authors**: Bryan R. Christ, Zack Gottesman, Jonathan Kropko, Thomas Hartvigsen
- **Published**: 2024-10-22
- **PDF URL**: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16930v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16930v2)

### Summary
Math reasoning is an active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research
because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence and has implications in
several domains, including math education. However, few works have explored how
math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can
be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to
improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster
understanding of how models encode math reasoning....
