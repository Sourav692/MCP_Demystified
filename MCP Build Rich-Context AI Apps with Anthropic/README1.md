Dear learner, 

 

Introducing [MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Anthropic](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/), our latest course made in collaboration with Anthropic and taught by Elie Schoppik, Head of Technical Education. 

 

Connecting AI applications to external systems like GitHub, Google Docs, or local files often means writing one-off code for each integration, a process that’s time-consuming and hard to scale. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, solves this by standardizing how LLMs interact with tools, data, and prompts.

 

This open protocol enables AI apps to access external resources through a consistent, reusable interface, built on a client-server architecture, similar to how web applications access APIs.

 

In this course, you’ll learn how to build AI applications that plug into a growing ecosystem of MCP-compatible servers quickly and reliably.

Join this course and learn:

- How MCP simplifies tool and data integration in LLM apps through a unified client-server protocol
- How to build and test your own MCP server using FastMCP and MCP Inspector
- How to adapt a Claude-powered chatbot into an MCP client that connects to both local and third-party servers
- How to expose tools, resources, and prompt templates to your AI app, and use them effectively
- How to connect your MCP server to applications like Claude Desktop and deploy it for remote access

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to build rich-context AI applications that can connect to a growing ecosystem of MCP servers, with minimal integration work.
